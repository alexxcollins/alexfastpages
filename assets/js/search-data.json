How to use the charts . The charts below offer a few ways of exploring covid data and seeing the evolution of cases and deaths in different countries or regions. . SARS-CoV-2 is the virus which causes Covid-19. For simplicity, I&#39;ll use the word &quot;covid&quot; interchangeably below. The spread of covid is influenced by inherent characteristics of the virus and the society in which it is present. The inherent contagiousness of covid shouldn&#39;t change much (although viruses evolve like any other living organism, and it is possible that covid evolves to something less deadly given that humanity has a strong incentive to obliterate the virus in its current form). The society it operates in can change radically, and lock-downs or mandatory mask wearing are attempts to reduce the spread (or R0) of the virus. . I hope the charts below will be useful as a tool to compare how the virus spreads in different societies, and even to help predict outcomes for deaths or cases in different countries or regions. I&#39;ve used data from John Hopkins CSSE via an API built by Kyle Redelinghuys. The data comes from various national and supranatoinal health authorities and is updated once a day. There is provincial data for some countries (e.g. Canadian and US States, Chinese provinces). . The charts below show total number of deaths and confirmed cases. Data on total cases should be viewed with caution as they are so dependent on how much testing is actually being done. Death data is much more indicative, but a lagging indicator of spread and should also be viewed with some caution as some countries (such as Italy) have a very broad definition of deaths caused by covid, and some do not record so many. For example, UK data only includes deaths in hospitals and not in the community or care homes. There is also the issue of reporting delays as deaths can take a few days to be reported, so you can&#39;t put too much weight on any given datapoint. . The &quot;doubling time&quot; charts are a really useful way of interpretting how curves are being flattened in an easy to interpret way. The data is just the rate of increase expressed as the number of days necessary to double the total number of cases or deaths. A region will be flattening the curve if their doubling time data look like a hockey stick - e.g. Italy or Spain. . Use these charts in conjunction with information about a region&#39;s response to covid to test hyphotheses about the effectiveness of public health measures. . Observations . The growth of US deaths remains worryingly high. The total deaths in the US are still doubling every four days and the curve is not bending at all. Death rates lag public health measures by two weeks or so, so the change in US death rates may be yet to come. Stay at home orders were issued between 19 March (California) and 4 April (Florida) with several states not having issued orders at all. Judging by death rates, no US states look to be entering the &quot;hockey stick&quot; stage of their growth rates yet. . In Europe, most countries appear to be slowing the increase of deaths. The UK is at a relatively early stage. . Chart below shows that death rate in the US is not showing any signs of improvment. UK is in the early days but change in death rate is so far consistent with Spanish and Italian experience. . Testing universal mask use . Mask wearing as a public health measure has been controversial with the WHO and CDC in United States arguing against masks (other than for healthcare professionals) for much of the crisis. However people such as Jeremy Howard (research scientist and founder of fast.ai, an articial intelligence organisation) and Nassim Taleb argue strongly for mask use. Jeremy made a short film advocating universal use of simple masks, which is worth watching. . Many Asian societies have a much wider use of masks than in the West and it has been noted that flatter curves in China and South Korea are correlated with more widespread mask use. However there are many other differentiating factors such as very comprehensive testing and contact tracing in South Korea which we just don&#39;t have in the West. Czechia and Austria have both mandated universal mask use in Europe. Other than that, these countries share more similarities with other European nations. The impact on death toll from these mask rules should be seen around mid-April for Czechia and end-April for Austria. It will be interesting to see whether we see any differences in these charts from those dates. . Keep an eye on how Austria and Czechia death rate evolves relative to other European countires without universal mask use. Regardless of masks, Austria and Czechia do appear to have flattened the curve quicker than Italy, France and Spain. . Full chart dashboard . The charts show either total number of deaths or cases. These are shown with a log scale and a dashed line representing what a daily 33% increase in deaths/cases would look like. . The &#39;doubling time&#39; charts are scatter plot charts showing the amount of time it would take the death or confirmed cases total to double if the rate of increase from the previous day continues. These charts have a line of best fit plotted, using the LOESS (local regression) method. The LOESS is intended to help the user visually gauge the trend of case increases rather than help make forecasts. . The daily change in death charts are self explanatory. They also have a LOESS line fitted to help gauge the trend. The LOESS fitting was set to give a closer fit for the daily change chart compared to the doubling time chart. The daily death charts are quite interesting because they really show the difference between areas serverely affected and those less so. For instance, compare New York with all other US states. It&#39;s much harder to appreciate the change in magnitude when looking at the log scale charts of total deaths. . The charts update every day so should always include the most recent data. . Tip: Click (Shift+ for multiple) on states in the legend to filter the visualizations below. Click outside the legend to highlight all states. . Tip: Hover the cursor over a point to see the underlying data - e.g. confirmed cases, deaths, rate of increase etc. In my notion &quot;cf_&quot; means &quot;compound factor&quot;. So &quot;cf_deaths = 1.2&quot; means that the number of deaths increased by 20% from the previous day. .",
