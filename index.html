# Dru Trading

![Dru](images/Dru.png)

Dru trading is a government bond and rates derivatives relative value hedge fund. Currently the fund is closed to outside investment.

## Why Dru?

The Dru is an iconic peak in the Mont Blanc Massiv, towering above the alpine town of Chamonix. It has fascinated mountaineers and climbers ever since the first ascent in 1878. The skills to climb mountains and trade financial markets are similar in many ways: mastery of basic techniques and ongoing risk evaluation and decion making in a dynamic environment where myriad uncertainties exist. 
Dru Trading believes in an Open Source approach to markets (our homepage is hosted on GitHub after all) and we hope our shared thoughts will be of interest and utility.
